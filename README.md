# SkBee

**SkBee** is a new [**Skript**](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) addon that aims to replace a few of my other addons, Sk-NBeeT, SkBoard and SkRecipe.   
By combining these addons, you can trim down the amount of required addons for your server and scripts.

## Elements
This is only a small list of the many things included
- **NBT elements** get/set NBT of items, blocks (tile entities) and entities. (Available for 1.8.8+)
- **ScoreBoards** super duper simple anti-flicker scoreboards (Available on 1.13+)
- **Recipes** add custom recipes and remove vanilla recipes (Available on 1.13+)
- **BlockData** get/set block data with ease (Available on 1.13+)
- **Structures** use vanilla Minecraft's structure system for saving/pasting structures in your world (Available for 1.9.4+)
